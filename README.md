Here you'll find one Jupyter notebook for each chapter of the book. The notebooks
contain all of the code in the book along with the code used to produce all of the
figures, other than those that were hand-drawn.

Include the path of `tuningup.py` in your PYTHONPATH.

Developed with Python 3.6.3 and Jupyter 5.4.0
